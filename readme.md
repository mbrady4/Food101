# Food 101: Building a 101 class convolutional neural network

This repository details an approach to building a high performing convolutional neural network which classifies images of food into 101 classes. 

The fully trained model achieves 85.3% top-1 accuracy on the test dataset specified by the food-101 dataset creators. The model achieves ~93% top-5 accuracy. 

The model is built upon the convolutional base of a trained ResNet50V2 model. Extensive image augmentation is utilized during training. Test time augmentation is utilized to boost top-1 performance. 

The model is built and trained primarily with the Keras library (TensorFlow backend).

This repository contains the following folders:
- Notebooks: 5 sequential notebooks which walkthrough the full model building process (data preparation, exporation, initial transfer learning, fine tuning, final training, and model evaluation).
- Predictions: Files which contain the predictions and labels generated by the final model which achieves 85.3% top-1 accuracy

Note, due to file size limitations, the models and dataset are not included in this repository. The full dataset can be download here: https://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets_extra/food-101/
